### Bike Repairs
#### The bikes used most frequently will probably be the ones that require the most maintenance, so we'll need to determine which bikes have the highest sum of "Number of Rides."

### Customer Breakdown
#### We want to find the proportion of short-term customers of the bike service to the annual subscribers.

If I were to add two visulalizations one would includes a breakdown of type of customer (short-term or yearly subscriber) based on highest usage age-groups age and the other would include a more detailed bike repair timeline visualization.
